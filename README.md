release-manager
===============

A task-based release manager. A sample project of mine where I can experiment 
with the following toolset:

* Domain driven design
* Test driven development
* Spring boot
* Spring REST + HATEOAS
* Gradle
* AngularJS

The intention of this project is to fit all these things into one project and 
one workflow.
